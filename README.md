Here three models exist:
1. Fine-tuned on open sources Yolo v8 for detecting all the UI elements
2. popup_det.pt which is also fine-tuned on open sources Yolo v8 detecting for detecting notifications
3. Also we fine tuned a faster-rcnn model but the results were not satisfactory that's why we fine tuned Yolo and it provided much better results
